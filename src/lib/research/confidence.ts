// Confidence is computed from the verifier's external, checkable signals — never
// asserted as a free-text model number. Two principles from the verification model:
//   1. CAP, don't average. A failed check ceilings confidence at that check's cap;
//      passing the other three cannot buy it back. (A stale-law or ungrounded claim
//      stays low no matter how clean the rest is.)
//   2. Self-consistency scales it. Instability across N re-runs lowers confidence;
//      full stability applies no penalty.
// Calibration (mapping these signals to a probability against labeled facilities,
// tracking ECE) is the next step; this is the structured, monotonic basis for it.
